## First Print

Rectangle length and width too big
Precision of 3D printer not enough to print 0.5mm teeth. Outer diameter too small (cannot fit into servo) Setting: 5.0mm inner, 6.0mm outer
Strength of knob seems good
Outer ring is unnecessary


## Second Print
Wall thickness affects strength
Outer diameter too big. Setting: 6.5mm inner, 8.5 outer

## Third Print
Setting: 5.0mm inner, 7.5 outer. Barely fits in. -> Just nice!
