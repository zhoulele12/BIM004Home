## First Print

Rectangle length and width too big
Precision of 3D printer not enough to print 0.5mm teeth. Outer diameter too small (cannot fit into servo) Setting: 5.0mm inner, 6.0mm outer
Strength of knob seems good (wall thickness 0.8, infill density 15)
Outer ring is unnecessary


## Second Print
Knob strength lost. Wall thickness? Printer?
Outer diameter too big. Setting: 6.5mm inner, 8.5 outer

## Third Print
Setting: 5.0mm inner, 7.5 outer. Barely fits in. -> Just nice!

## Fourth Print
teeth to be less visible. Infill density different. (9% was good)
Tried to increase knob width. Still weak.

## Fifth Print
Infill density 8%, 1.2mm wall thickness, 0.25mm nozzle size
