## First Print
Rectangle length and width too big
Precision of 3D printer not enough to print 0.5mm teeth. Outer diameter too small (cannot fit into servo) Setting: 5.0mm inner, 6.0mm outer
Strength of knob seems good (wall thickness 0.8, infill density 15, nozzle size 0.25mm)
Outer ring is unnecessary

## Second Print
Knob strength lost. Wall thickness? Printer?
Outer diameter too big. Setting: 6.5mm inner, 8.5 outer

## Third Print - teeth only C12
Setting: 5.0mm inner, 7.5 outer. Barely fits in -> Just nice!

## Fourth Print C12
teeth less visible. Infill density different. (9% was good)
Tried to increase knob width. Still weak.

## Fifth Print-green C6
wall thickness 1.2mm Infill density 8%, 0.25mm nozzle size
teeth visible again. -> infill density seems to be the issue (As it turned out, not really).
knob strength still not good 

## Sixth Print-grey C14
wall thickness 1.2mm Infill density 5% -> strength restored
To further increase strength -> shorten knob

## Seventh Print orange B7
wall thickness 0.8mm Infill density 9% -> strength still there

## Eighth Print orange B7
wall thickness 0.8mm Infill density 5% -> strength still there

## Ninth Print
wall thickness 0.8mm Infill density 15% -> teeth retained -> **infill-density doesn't matter**

## Tenth Print
wall thickness 1.2mm Infill density 9% 

Tested all. Teeth seem to be a good fit already
Good setting at this point: infill density 9%, wall thickness 1.2mm, 0.25mm nozzle
Knob strength is the main bottle neck

## Modifications:
To further increase strength -> shorten knob, change shape to fit better (add circle, wider, longer)
decrease base height by 1mm.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After printing the same design with the same parameters at different printers, conclusion reached -> **PRINTER MATTERS**

## Circular Knob Design
B7 printer, wall thickness 1.2mmm, infill density 9% 
Strength increased massively with new design. 
Further steps to take: 
1. Further increase knob length, width, and circle diameter -> better fit
2. Tweak base height for larger friction
3. Curved surface for larger friction
4. Try thinner layers and higher infill density
